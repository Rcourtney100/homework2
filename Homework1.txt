Below is a list of features that I find to be attractive on various websites/apps:

1. Color scheme

-https://theringer.com- The green/white/black color scheme is an attractive yet simple backdrop that provides a signature style to the site and isn’t  visually distracting. While the site does have a small “Miller Lite” logo to show one of it’s sponsors, you are not bombarded with banner ads and videos which serve to distract you from the content.

-https://www.trycaviar.com- I find the orange/white to also provide a simple and attractive style that users will associate with the caviar brand but does not prove distracting to the eye when using the site.

-www.vulture.com- Once again this sites main colors are a simple blue/black/white that serves to be an attractive backdrop but does not distract from the massive amount of content.

2. Navigation tools

-https://www.spotify.com/us/- I find this site very simple and easy to use in terms of navigation. You are able to search the site and the mobile app very quickly and easily using either an artist's name, a certain music genre, name of a song or the particular name of an album.

-http://www.espn.com- This site also has very simple navigation tools
