<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I was born and raised in the Philadelphia Area, and have lived around here for most of my life. I currently reside in Fishtown with my girlfriend and two cats. I enjoy cooking, seeing new movies and hanging out with friends.</p>

	<p>I recently decided on a career change to web development from my previous background in sales, and am very excited to learn something new and explore opportunities.</p>
