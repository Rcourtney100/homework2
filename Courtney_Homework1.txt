Below is a list of features that I find to be attractive on various websites/apps:

1. Color scheme

-https://theringer.com- The green/white/black color scheme is an attractive yet simple backdrop that provides a signature style to the site and isn’t  visually distracting. While the site does have a small “Miller Lite” logo to show one of it’s sponsors, you are not bombarded with banner ads and videos which serve to distract you from the content.

-https://www.trycaviar.com- I find the orange/white to also provide a simple and attractive style that users will associate with the caviar brand but does not prove distracting to the eye when using the site.

-www.vulture.com- Once again this sites main colors are a simple blue/black/white that serves to be an attractive backdrop but does not distract from the massive amount of content.

2. Navigation tools

-https://www.spotify.com/us/- I find this site very simple and easy to use in terms of navigation. You are able to search the site and the mobile app very quickly and easily using either an artist's name, a certain music genre, name of a song or the particular name of an album.

-http://www.espn.com- This site also has very simple navigation tools, which allow site visitors to move around the site very easily. There is a search bar where you can type in key words on what you are looking for, or search for specific previous articles. There is also a main search bar on the site where you can search by each individual sport and get the corresponding current events. Navigation is very important on sites like this because they have huge amounts of articles and stories to keep track of.

-https://www.amazon.com/- This is an example of a site where I don't like their navigation as much. I feel that there are too many options to select and alot of the categories overlap in their offerings. Oftentimes I find it hard to locate certain items as well.


3. Functionality

-https://www.spotify.com/us/- This is my number one site for playing and storing music. The functionality is great in terms of having instant access to millions of songs instantly. It is also very simple and intuitive to compile playlists, and download songs or full albums.

-https://www.trycaviar.com- This is a web application that I mainly use on my phone for ordering food. It is very quick and easy to navigate restaurants in your area and search based on the type of food that you want. There are also pictures of every entree on the menu which is helpful as well. Your food order can also be easily tracked as well.  This in my eyes makes the app superior and easier to use than sites like Postmates or GrubHub.

-https://www.youtube.com- This is also a great site for searching millions of videos on millions of topics. It is very simple to find any type of video you would need by simply typing keywords in the search box, and choosing from the options presented to you. It is also good at keeping a record of previous searches and customizing what topics are presented upon first opening the app.

4. Layout
-https://theringer.com- The layout of this site is very simple yet effective. It lists articles in chronological order and you are able to search their archives using keywords. The layout is very polished and professional, yet simple and not overwhelming on the eye. Titles of articles are listed simply in bold and the content is very simple and easy to read.

-http://www.cnn.com- The layout of this site leaves something to be desired. While it does effectively show important topics, the layout does seem a little thrown together at times and less polished than it should be for a major news site. I imagine that keeping the site up to date with breaking news stories 24/7 probably contributes to that, and causes the site to focus more on releasing content instantly than focusing heavily on attractive layout. There is a lot of clickbait on the site which is annoying as well as an abundance of videos that just start playing without you choosing to watch them.

-https://www.youtube.com- I find the layout of this site to be very simple and effective in terms of helping you find what you want. Simply typing in keywords will get you a list of videos on the very topic you were looking for.  It is somewhat minimalist but effective

5. Content
https://theringer.com- This is a great site for looking at interesting takes on everything from sports, music, tv, movies, video games, politics and almost anything else you can think of. It is very unique in the variety of topics it covers and the point of view of it's various writers. I think this sets the site apart from alot of other traditional media sites

www.espn.com- I love sports and this is the best site to come to for getting the latest on every sport you can imagine. While the site itself isn't totally unique in it's content, I think that the combination of their great writing staff and their ability to churn out interesting articles on a daily basis sets it above other outlets.

https://www.netflix.com- I have oftentimes used the phone app version of this site when I have some free time and am not near a television. I find this site great at searching movies as well as original content and very easy to use and intuitive for the phone. I am somewhat of a movie buff and enjoy having this site available for use on my phone
